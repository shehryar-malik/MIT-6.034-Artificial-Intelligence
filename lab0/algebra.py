# Section 3: Algebraic simplification

# This code implements a simple computer algebra system, which takes in an
# expression made of nested sums and products, and simplifies it into a
# single sum of products. The goal is described in more detail in the
# problem set writeup.

# Much of this code is already implemented. We provide you with a
# representation for sums and products, and a top-level simplify() function
# which applies the associative law in obvious cases. For example, it
# turns both (a + (b + c)) and ((a + b) + c) into the simpler expression
# (a + b + c).

# However, the code has a gap in it: it cannot simplify expressions that are
# multiplied together. In interesting cases of this, you will need to apply
# the distributive law.

# Your goal is to fill in the do_multiply() function so that multiplication
# can be simplified as intended. 

# Testing will be mathematical:  If you return a flat list that
# evaluates to the same value as the original expression, you will
# get full credit.


# We've already defined the data structures that you'll use to symbolically
# represent these expressions, as two classes called Sum and Product,
# defined below. These classes both descend from the abstract Expression class.
#
# The top level function that will be called is the .simplify() method of an
# Expression.
#
# >>> expr = Sum([1, Sum([2, 3])])
# >>> expr.simplify()
# Sum([1, 2, 3])


### Expression classes _____________________________________________________

# Expressions will be represented as "Sum()" and "Product()" objects.
# These objects can be treated just like lists (they inherit from the
# "list" class), but you can test for their type using the "isinstance()"
# function.  For example:
#
# >>> isinstance(Sum([1,2,3]), Sum)
# True
# >>> isinstance(Product([1,2,3]), Product)
# True
# >>> isinstance(Sum([1,2,3]), Expression) # Sums and Products are both Expressions
# True

    "This abstract class does nothing on its own."
